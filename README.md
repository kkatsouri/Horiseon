# Horiseon
## Description
This repo was created for the first weekly challenge for my webdev bootcamp. This challenge came in the form of an 'On-the-job ticket'. We were provided with a starter code and scenario in which we needed to review and improve upon the code of a website for a marketing agency.

As a new bootcamp student this challenge helped me to learn about the importance of accessability, and gave me a change to practice refactoring CSS.

The information provided to us was as follows:

User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

I made these changes to the starter code:
- added alt elements to images for accessability
- worked on refactoring the CSS code to remove repetition
- added comments to CSS so it was clear what changes were made
- fixed a faulty link
- added a title 
- performed regular commits to Github with clear descriptions

The following images show the website following refactoring:
